== Usage

Factor can be used to define a custom element.

[source,html]
----
<my-greeter name="Everyone"></my-greeter>
<script type="module">
  import { define } from '@potient/factor/Factor.js'
  const MyGreeter = define('MyGreeter', {
    props: {
      name: { type: String, default: 'World' }
    },
    template: '<p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>'

More documentation is on the way.
